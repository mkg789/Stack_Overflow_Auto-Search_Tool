# Stack_Overflow_Auto-Search_Tool
A tool that will detect errors and redirect you to the related stack overflow pages in the web browser.
How the program works is shown in the block diagram.
the test_program.py has an intentional error, that error will be detected by the wrapper_script.py, and then it will redirect you to the stack overflow pages.
